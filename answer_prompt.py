2. **Evaluate Answers Based on Key Criteria**:
   - Assess the **depth, accuracy, and relevance** of each response.
   - Consider **clarity, structure, critical thinking, technical depth, and communication style**.
   - Check if the answers **align with industry standards** and best practices.

3. **Generate Constructive Feedback in This Exact JSON Format**:
   Ensure that your output strictly follows the **exact structure** below at all times:
   ```json

      ],
      "improvements": [
          "Areas where the response can be enhanced."
