   {
    "quiz": "What is React?",
    "answer": "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the UI using a virtual DOM, improving performance. React follows a component-based architecture and supports state management using hooks and context. It is widely used for developing modern web applications due to its flexibility, efficiency, and strong ecosystem."
  },
  {
    "quiz": "How do you handle debugging complex issues in a production environment?",
    "answer": "Handling debugging in a production environment requires a structured approach to minimize downtime and ensure system stability. Here’s how I approach it:
              Log Analysis – I leverage structured logging (e.g., using Winston for Node.js or Logback for Java) to analyze logs in real-time via centralized logging systems like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Grafana.
              Monitoring & Alerts – I use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana or cloud services like AWS CloudWatch to track system performance and identify anomalies.
              Reproducing Issues – If possible, I replicate the issue in a staging environment to debug safely without affecting users.
              Remote Debugging – For critical issues, I use debugging tools like Chrome DevTools, Postman for API testing, and remote debugging capabilities in VS Code or IntelliJ.
              Error Tracking – I integrate tools like Sentry or Datadog to capture unhandled exceptions and track them efficiently.
              Rollback & Hotfixes – If an issue severely impacts production, I coordinate with the team to rollback to a stable version while working on a fix.
              Code Reviews & Testing – I ensure thorough testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end) and peer reviews to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
              This structured approach helps me efficiently diagnose and resolve production issues while maintaining system stability.

    "answer": "As a Software Engineer at iTelaSoft (Pvt) Ltd., I have been actively involved in developing and maintaining web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks like React.js for the front end and Node.js for the back end. I have also worked with Java (Maven) and WildFly for backend services, ensuring seamless integration with various front-end applications.
              One of my key contributions was optimizing the bank loan origination system for RDB Bank Sri Lanka, improving performance and user experience. I also played a crucial role in integrating Keycloak for authentication and enhancing security.
              A significant challenge I faced was troubleshooting API connectivity issues between Nginx and WildFly containers in a Dockerized environment. After thorough debugging, I successfully configured the network to enable seamless communication between services.
              Additionally, balancing my professional responsibilities with academic commitments in my top-up degree has been a challenge, but I have managed it effectively while maintaining high performance in both areas."

    "quiz": "What is React?",
    "answer": "React is some JavaScript thing that helps make websites. It does something with components, and I think it’s related to Angular or something."
  },
  {
    "quiz": "How do you handle debugging complex issues in a production environment?",
    "answer": "I just refresh the page and hope it works. If that doesn’t fix it, I restart the server. If it’s still broken, I blame the backend team. Logs are too long, so I don’t really check them. If nothing works, I push a new update and see if that helps."
